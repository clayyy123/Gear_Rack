# Gear Rack
--
### About:
Gear Rack is an online web application where users can store gear information and look up other people's gear who are part of the community.  Gear Rack also has a backpack weight calculator for future outdoor activities  

### Approach:
My approach for this project was a lot better than my battleship project.  I made a trello board, Balsaqmiq wireframes, and notes.  I also focused on the MVP, which directed me to develop the foundation of the application first, which led to more time on developing the extra features.   
Here is my Trello board:
 [Trello](https://trello.com/b/lWHrmXxg/gear-rack)

### Technology Used:
I used Ruby on Rails to develop most of the front end and back end of the application.  HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS were used to style the pages. A little Javascript to give functions to some of the buttons. 

### Installation/ StartUp Instructions:

1. Go to my Github profile, clayyy123, fork and clone the files under Gear Rack.
2. Create a database with PostGres that is connected to the file.
3. Open the code on VS code or Sublime for editing.
4. Run "rails server" on the terminal and open the app on localhost:3000.

### Problems and Challenges:

#### Problems and Challenges
1. Overthinking the code.  
2. Designing the layout of the applicaton.
3. Googling help.
4. Getting used to Bootstrap and CSS
5. Finding the right direction to figuring out a problem on Rails.

#### Next Steps:
Next step is to the start creating simple applications on RoR to get used to the framework and understanding each line of code.  Try to add new features to Gear Rack to learn the different uses RoR can provide.
